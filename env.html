With ease of access and availability, public areas have become havens for those
who cannot find appropriate shelter. Encampments or communal shelters have become
a massive threat to the environment. we can see this in our own backyard in hawthorne. when I walk home from school there is a massive homless encamampent where m and my friends would smoke and it is now unavilable due to these people who have dicded to live there. another problem is that neaddles and syringes are consatnly being found and left around these encampents and the sad part is most of them are in public places such as parks. </h1>
