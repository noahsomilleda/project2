<h1>
Who is Affected by Homelessness?
</h1>

<h1>Many people are affected by homelessness in different ways. Many innocent people can not meet their basic needs because of the state they are in. Children hold up to 46% of the homeless population and they can not get education that they deserve. Women are affected also because people rarely see them on the street, this is because women are scared of the outside world in fear of violence, rape, sexual abuse and other abuses. Women usually end up on the street because of family breakdown, domestic violence, or sexual abuse. This means the women's children are affected as well. Lastly people with illnesses are affected by not obtaining the medical attention they need by living on the street.</h1>
